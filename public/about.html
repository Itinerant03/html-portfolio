<hr/>
<p>Hello! I'm Subhankar Sharma, a recent graduate with a B.Sc in Forensic Science from Jharkhand Raksha Shakti University, Ranchi. My academic journey has equipped me with strong analytical skills, a keen eye for detail, and a passion for solving complex problems. These traits, along with my enthusiasm for learning, have driven me to explore new fields and expand my skill set.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm diving into the world of web development. As a beginner, I’ve already developed this page and am excited to continue honing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The process of building something from scratch and seeing it come to life online is incredibly fulfilling, and I’m eager to learn more.</p>

<p>My experience as a private tutor has sharpened my communication skills, allowing me to effectively convey complex concepts in a simple, understandable way. This experience, coupled with my background in forensic science, has taught me the importance of precision, adaptability, and continuous learning.</p>

<p>I’m always looking for opportunities to grow, whether it’s through collaborative projects, self-learning, or diving into new challenges. My goal is to integrate my technical skills with my passion for communication and problem-solving to contribute meaningfully to whatever field I’m in.</p>

<p>Thank you for visiting my page! Feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect or collaborate.</p>
